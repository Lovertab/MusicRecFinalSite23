<p class="summary">Hip hop music or hip-hop music, also known as rap music and formerly known as disco rap, is a genre of popular music that originated in the Bronx borough of New York City in the early 1970s. It consists of stylized rhythmic music (usually built around drumbeats) that commonly accompanies rapping, a rhythmic and rhyming speech that is chanted. It developed as part of hip hop culture, a subculture defined by four key stylistic elements: MCing/rapping, DJing/scratching with turntables, break dancing, and graffiti writing. Other elements include sampling beats or bass lines from records (or synthesized beats and sounds), and rhythmic beatboxing. While often used to refer solely to rapping, "hip hop" more properly denotes the practice of the entire subculture. The term hip hop music is sometimes used synonymously with the term rap music, though rapping is not a required component of hip hop music; the genre may also incorporate other elements of hip hop culture, including DJing, turntablism, scratching, beatboxing, and instrumental tracks.
Hip hop as both a musical genre and a culture was formed during the 1970s when block parties became increasingly popular in New York City, particularly among African American youth residing in the Bronx. At block parties, DJs played percussive breaks of popular songs using two turntables and a DJ mixer to be able to play breaks from two copies of the same record, alternating from one to the other and extending the "break". Hip hop's early evolution occurred as sampling technology and drum machines became widely available and affordable. Turntablist techniques such as scratching and beatmatching developed along with the breaks. Rapping developed as a vocal style in which the artist speaks or chants along rhythmically with an instrumental or synthesized beat.

<h3>Abstract Hiphop<!--sub genre name--></h3>
<p>Abstract hip hop is a form of Hip Hop characterized by rappers employing more abstract lyrics compared to the conventional norms of the genre. The content of the lyrics encompasses a wide spectrum, ranging from philosophical and abstract concepts to absurd and stream-of-consciousness ideas. In contrast to the direct and explicit language commonly found in mainstream hip hop, abstract hip hop favors the use of extensive metaphors, symbolic word choices, and enigmatic meanings. Many artists within this style deviate from the usual conventions of rhyme and rhythm in their rapping, instead incorporating unconventional poetic meters that sometimes resemble Spoken Word. Moreover, abstract hip hop musicians often feature unconventional beats that complement the unorthodox lyrical approach, often blurring the lines with Experimental Hip Hop. </p>

<h3>Korean HipHop<!--sub genre name--></h3>
<p>Korean hip hop, also known as K-hip hop or K-rap, is a subgenre of Korean popular music.  
It is widely considered to have originated in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and has since become increasingly popular, both in Korea and abroad.  
While Korea's hip hop culture includes various elements such as rap, graffiti, DJing, turntablism, and b-boying, rapping comprises a significant part of the culture. The term "hip hop" is largely recognized and understood as "rap" in Korea. The interplay between the Korean language and English has been used as a technical and aesthetic device in Korean hip-hop. Many Korean hip-hop songs boast syllabic similarities that could be interpreted in either language. The bilingual aspect of this music is one distinguishing factor between Korean hip hop and American hip hop. 
As early-stage Korean hip-hop was heavily influenced by African-American hip-hop, Korean hip-hop artists naturally started using AAVE in their lyrics. The dominance of Korean-Americans in the Korean hip-hop scene also contributed to the use of mixed languages in Korean hip-hop. English-speaking Korean diaspora artists such as Drunken Tiger, Epik High's Tablo, Swings, Jay Park, and San E have included English lyrics in their raps and attracted the interest of the young generation. </p>

<h3>Mumble Rap<!--sub genre name--></h3>
<p>Mumble rap is known for its emphasis on the overall vibe and energy of the music rather than intricate lyricism or storytelling. The lyrics often prioritize catchy phrases, ad-libs, and repetitive rhymes over deep meaning or complex wordplay. As the name suggests, mumble rap artists sometimes deliver their vocals in a way that can be difficult to understand or decipher, with a focus on the flow and melody rather than clear articulation. </p>
